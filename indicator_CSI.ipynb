Based on the IF, we can more or less obtain the knowledge of journals, yet for full dataset of publications, else we can say panorama, we need more than just the IFs (Larivière et al., 2016; Milojevic et al., 2017).\n",

(2017) presented Citation success index with an acronym of CSI, which designed and defined as the probability that a random paper in journal A has more citations than a random paper in journal B, when comparing full datasets of publications within these two journals. The equation is given as below.  \n",
